This directory contains a version of the DemoComp that includes
a front end (i.e., a simple lexer and a parser) 

The parser has been built using jacc from the source file DC.jacc.
If you have jacc, you can generate the DCParser.java and DCTokens.java
files for yourself using the command:

  jacc DC.jacc

Don't worry if you don't have jacc; you can either download a copy from
http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~mpj/jacc, or just use the DCParser.java and
DCTokens.java files that are included here.

To compile the Java sources for this version of DemoComp, including the
files in the included "compiler" library, use the following command line:

  javac compiler/*.java *.java

Now you can run the compiler using a command of the form:

  java DemoComp filename.dc

I've included a few DemoComp source files (with a .dc suffix) for you
to play with, but you can of course create your own ...

Have fun!
